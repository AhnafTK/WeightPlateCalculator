What is Weight plate calculator?
Weight Plate Calculator is an excercise tool that calculates the number of weight plates needed for a given weight. 
For example, The user wants to load their barbell for a 135 lbs bench press. They'd need to input the total weight of 135 and the barbell weight of 45.
Using these two numbers, the program calculates the weight of plates, and how many the user needs. In this case..
Total weight : 135
Barbell weight: 45
45's needed: 1
35's needed : 0
.. and so on.
